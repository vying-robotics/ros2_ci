# Creates SSH key Jenkins uses to read this repository (GitHub deploy key)
# and adds github.com to the known hosts Jenkins checks
# Based on Jenkins Basics for Robotics, 7.2 Install and Setup the Git Plugin (setup_ssh_git.sh)
# Changes:
#   - own key for this repository
#   - key and github.com host keys kept in ~/webpage_ws (saved with the rosject),
#     ~/webpage_ws/known_hosts is shared with ros1_ci (host keys fetched only if missing)
#   - host keys copied to ~/.ssh/known_hosts (also done by start_jenkins.sh on every start)
#   - no git config changes

# Exit on any error
